G
You're the nose on my bullet
The trigger on my gun
           B
You're the sandbank in the ocean
Oxygen in my blood
           C
You're the fastest of the fish
You're the prickliest pear
         G
You're a chameleon in the night
You're the sahara's sun glare

G
You're my mind's rest
You're the strings on my guitar
           Am
You're the wax in my moustache
The keys to my car
           D
You're the magical mermaid's hollowed illusion
You cool them, fool them
And they hope so much
        G
And you let them down
And you watch from your rock
And your heart beats fast as you watch their's stop

G
I will keep on loving
'Cos I believe in love
  Am
I don't mind dying
If you follow me up
     G
Your victory's your defeat
Your head above your heart
Am                  
Only the brave surrender
D
Death cannot tear us apart

Interlude: G  Am  D  G

G
Well my smile is wider
Than your's when we meet
        B
And the winter is colder
For me underneath
      C
And I know that you glow
From the inside out
        G
You can keep it for yourself
And I'll go without

G
You are the fire and I'm the chimney
You'll burn away and I'll choke on your memory
        Am
All the words, my sense, you're the poet to my pen
You're the dream that brings the morning sadness
D                         G
Start the day storm in my head
G
Well you're the Oscar Wilde short stories in my bookcase
       Am
You're positively 4th street isolated in my itunes
           D
You're the word in the dictionary that I can't spell
                               G
Can't describe, can't put in a sentence but use all the time
G
Your own pair of trousers look better on me
    Am
The boots of spanish leather
And the bottom of the sea
      D
Every symbol of love that doesn't relate to a meaning
      G
Every feeling, every sensation
Only real when I'm dreaming

G
I will keep on loving
'Cos I believe in love
  Am
I don't mind dying
If you follow me up
G
Your victory's your defeat
Your head above your heart
Am
Only the brave surrender
D                             G
Death cannot tear us apart

G
Well I wish we were animals free of loves games
  Am
I wish we were snails with really big shells
  D
I wish I was a lion, I'd be king of the wild
    G
I'd command all the beasts to carry you when you're tired

G
I'm the elephant in the circus
Oh, you're my trainer
      Am
You'd never let me go
But if you did I would stay here
   D
In love there is freedom
But it must be returned
      G
There must be sacrifice
Love must be learnt
  G
A donkey, a mule, a lifetime of work
   Am
In death he rests his head from his reins
No burden to bare but work left him lame
        D
And the lion on the mountain chased from his pride
His lioness stolen, his rival survives
    G (let ring...)
The sound of his cubs in death are dim
He knows his world well, no pain can defeat him

G                  Am
Wild horses in the wilderness
     D               G
Will know no journey home
                          Am
Well my love is locked in chains
    D          G
The lion walks alone
            Am
Oh the lion walks alone
D
Nature is cruel
       G
But he knows it's his home
G
He to his demons
    Am
And you to your own
D
Please let me stand by you
          G
And we'll conquer them all
G       Am
We will conquer them all
   D      G
Oh I will conquer them all (x3)
