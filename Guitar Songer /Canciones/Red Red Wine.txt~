  Red red wine,
             C#  F#  G#
  Go to my head,
                    C#  F#  G#
  Make me forget that I
             C#  F#  G#
  Still need her so,
              C#  F#  G#
  Red red wine,
             C#  F#  G#
  It's up to you,
                C#  F#  G#
  All I can do I've done,
                   C# F# G#
  But memories won't go,
       G#            F# G#  
  No, memories won't go..



  C# F# G#
             G#
  I have sworn,
              C#
  That with time,
              F#                 C#
  Thoughts of you would leave my head,
          G#         C#
  I was wrong and I find,
             F#                 G#
  Just one thing makes me forgetâ€¦



          C# F# G# 
  Red red wine,
                 C# F# G#
  Stay close to me,
                  C# F# G#
  Don't let me be alone,
                  C# F# G#
  It's tearing apart
     G#             F# G#
  My blue, blue heart.
