Intro 5x: C11  C

Primeira parte:

                                C11  C
I've been trying to do it right
                                 C11  C
I've been living the lonely life
                                C11  C
I've been sleeping here instead
                              Am
I've been sleeping in my bed
                          G  C11  C
I've been sleeping in my bed

(C11  C)(2x)

                  C11  C
So show me family
                                    C11  C
And all the blood that I will bleed
                            C11  C
I don't know where I belong
                                 Am
I don't know where I went wrong
                   G     C11  C
But I can write a song.

Refrão:

               Am                   G
I belong with you, you belong with me
                C
You're my sweet___heart
               Am                   G
I belong with you, you belong with me
            C11  C (5x)
You're my sweet

Primeira parte:

                                   C11  C
I don't think you're right for him
                                     C11  C
Think of what it might've been if you
                        C11  C
Took a bus to Chinatown
                         Am
I'd be standing on Canal
     G      C11  C
And Bowery
Am                             G  C11  C
And she'd be standing next to me

Refrão 2x:
               Am                   G

You're my sweet___heart

Terceira parte:

     C11      G       C
And love, we need it now
       C11      G
Let's hope for some
    C11         G      C
Cuz oh, we're bleeding out

Refrão:

               Am                   G
I belong with you, you belong with me
                C
You're my sweet___heart
