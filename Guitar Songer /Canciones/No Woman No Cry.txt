[Verse]

C           G      Am                  F
   Said I remember when we used to sit
C                    G       Am         F      
   In the government yard in Trenchtown
C         G         Am             F 
   Oba, oba-serving the hypocrites 
        C            G                    Am        F
As they would mingle with the good people we meet
C                       G         Am                F
   Good friends we have had, oh good friends we've lost 
C      G         Am       F
       along the way
C           G               Am                F
   In this great future you can't forget your past
C      G               Am        F
   So dry your tears I say


[Chorus]

C     G             Am F 
   No woman, no cry
   C  F7 Am7  D9  C        G
   No woman,  no cry
C               G             Am       F
   Dear Little darlin, don't shed no tears
   C  F7 Am7  D9  C        G
   No woman,  no cry
G
Say, say...


[Verse]

C           G      Am                  F
   Said I remember when we used to sit
C                    G       Am          F      
   In the government yard in Trenchtown
C              G              Am         F
And then Georgie would make the fire lights,
         C         G                   Am       F
as it was, logwood burnin' through the nights
C                G              Am         F
   Then we would cook cornmeal porridge
C              G         Am         F
Of which I'll share with you, oooh.
C     G          Am        F
   My feet is my only carriage
C              G          Am                   
So I've got to push on through. 
               F
But, while I'm gone,


[Bridge]

C                  G
Everything's gonna be all right!
Am                 F7

   No woman,  no cry
C               G      Am              F
   oh no Little sister,  don't shed no tears
   C  F7 Am7  D9  C        G
   No woman,  no cry
