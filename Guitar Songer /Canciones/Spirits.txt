The Strumbellas

[Chorus]

          F                      C
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Am                            G
Spirits in my head and they won't go
         F                      C
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Am                           G
Spirits in my head and they won't


[Instrumental]

F  C  Am  G 
F  C  Am  G 


[Verse]

C      G                      F
I Been looking at the stars tonight
             C        G                 F
And I think oh how I miss that bright sun
C           G                    F
I'll be a dreamer till the day I die
              C          G            F
but they say oh how the good die young
               Am
But were all strange 
                            G
and maybe we don't want to change


[Chorus]

         F                      C
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Am                            G
Spirits in my head and they won't go
         F                      C
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Em                           Am
Spirits in my head and they won't go
         F                    C                 G
But the gun still rattles, the gun still rattles ohh
       F                        C
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Am                          G
Spirits in my head and they won't go


[Verse]

C          G                    F  
I spend a lot of nights on the run
            C      G                 F
and I think oh I'm lost and cant be found
C          G                    F
I'm just waiting for my day to come
            C          G               F
and I think oh I don't want to let you down
                             Am
cause something inside has changed
                                    G
and maybe we don't want to stay the same


[Chorus]

         F                      C
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Am                            G
Spirits in my head and they won't go
         F                      C
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Em                           Am
Spirits in my head and they won't go
         F                    C                 G
But the gun still rattles, the gun still rattles ohh
         F                    C                 G
But the gun still rattles, the gun still rattles ohh

    F              C      
And I don't want a never ending life
        G                          Am
I just want to be alive while I'm here
    F              C      
And I don't want a never ending life
        G                          Am
I just want to be alive while I'm here
    F               C    
And I don't want to see another night
       G                            Am
lost inside a lonely life while I'm here

         F                      C
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Am                            G
Spirits in my head and they won't go
         F                      C
I got guns in my head and they won't go
Em                           Am
Spirits in my head and they won't go
         F                    C                 G
But the gun still rattles, the gun still rattles ohh
         F                    C                 G
But the gun still rattles, the gun still rattles ohh
